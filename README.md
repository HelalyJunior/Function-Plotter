## Description
The program is a simple GUI Powered by **Unity** that allows users to plot mathematical functions given in certain rules.
## Main Flow
The program starts with a login screen where the user is prompted to type his/her name and then proceed to the main screen. One can then type in a mathematical function of one variable and click **Plot!**
The program will remember the user if the application was closed and re-opened as long as the user didn't log out.
## Technologies used
The GUI is made by **Unity Engine**.
The plotting of the function is done by **matplotlib**
## How The program works
The program is composed of two main elements.
  - The user-interface side where the error handling is done , written in **C#**
  - The logical unit behind the scenes written in **python**
The two parts communicate between each other using ***.txt*** files , which can be inefficient but in this simple case , it can be ok to use it.
## How to use the Application?
All you need to do to use the API is to extract the ***.RAR*** file and run ***Function_plotter.exe***

*****Don't*** Close the program while running by ***ALT+F4***, use the exit button , or it will load an old function**.
